In Go, `json.Marshal` returns an error in a few specific scenarios where the data structure provided to it cannot be serialized into JSON. These scenarios include:

1. **Unsupported Types**: Go's `json` package does not support the serialization of certain types. If you try to marshal channels, functions, or complex numbers, `json.Marshal` will return an error.

2. **Cyclic References**: If the data structure contains cyclic references (i.e., a struct that directly or indirectly references itself), `json.Marshal` will return an error. JSON cannot represent cyclic data structures.

3. **Invalid UTF-8 Strings**: If a string or a slice of bytes contains invalid UTF-8 sequences and is set to be marshaled into a JSON string, `json.Marshal` may return an error since JSON strings must be valid UTF-8.

4. **Marshaler Errors**: If a type implements the `json.Marshaler` interface and its `MarshalJSON` method returns an error, `json.Marshal` will propagate that error.

5. **Pointer to Uninitialized Struct**: If you pass a pointer to an uninitialized struct (a nil pointer), `json.Marshal` will return an error.

6. **Large Floating-Point Values**: Extremely large floating-point values (like `math.Inf` or `math.NaN`) can cause `json.Marshal` to return an error, as they do not have a direct representation in JSON.

7. **Unsupported Map Key Types**: In Go, a map can have keys of nearly any type, but JSON only supports string keys in objects. If you try to marshal a map with non-string keys (like `map[int]string`), `json.Marshal` will return an error.

It's important to note that `json.Marshal` does not return an error for marshaling private (unexported) struct fields. Instead, it silently ignores them. To include private fields in the JSON output, you either need to export these fields (make their first letter uppercase) or provide a custom marshaling method.

Understanding these conditions can help in ensuring that the data structures used with `json.Marshal` are compatible with JSON's serialization requirements.
